LunariStock

Windows Form Stock Market Application for our DND campaign

Download the .exe file and put it on your desired folder. When application is first opened it will create few .txt files to the folder it is in. These files are used to store data.

Here is the direct link to download the .exe file: bin/Release/LunariStock.exe (https://github.com/Juho95/LunarisStock/blob/main/LunariStock.exe)
